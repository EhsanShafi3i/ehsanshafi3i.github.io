# Who is Ehsan Shafiei?
I'm a back-end developer specializing in Django, and I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself with difficult problems.

I'm also interested in cybersecurity and have studied various vulnerabilities. Additionally, I love both learning and teaching because I believe teaching is an essential part of the learning process.

That's why Iâ€™d like to share my experiences on my blog.

The name Cozy Bytes reflects my vision for this blog a warm and welcoming place,also I always want to use this word somewhere.

"Cozy" represents a friendly and engaging atmosphere, making complex topics easier to understand.
"Bytes" symbolizes the computers.

Through this blog, I aim to share knowledge, experiences, and insights in a way that feels both informative and inviting.
