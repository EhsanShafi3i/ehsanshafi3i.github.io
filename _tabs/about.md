# Who is Ehsan Shafiei?
I'm a back-end developer specializing in Django, and I enjoy learning new things and challenging myself with difficult problems.

I'm also interested in cybersecurity and have studied various vulnerabilities. Additionally, I love both learning and teaching because I believe teaching is an essential part of the learning process.

That's why Iâ€™d like to share my experiences on my blog.
